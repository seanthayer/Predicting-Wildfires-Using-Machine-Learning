# Wildfire Data Analysis
Wildfire Data Analysis is a project to predict wildfires by climate information through machine learning methods. 

## Required Library
Python 3.7
matplotlib 3.7.1
numpy 1.23.5
pandas 1.5.3
seaborn 0.12.2

## Background
Wildfires refer to fires that occur in natural environments such as mountains and forests. Wildfires are usually caused by natural causes, such as lightning, drought, etc., and may also be caused by human beings. Wildfires have serious impacts on the environment and humans and threaten human life and property. It takes various preventive measures to prevent the occurrence and spread of wildfires, such as regular forest clearing, enhanced monitoring and early warning, and prescribed burning. Our project uses climate information in a region to predict the occurrence of wildfires, which can help forest management make timely plans.
